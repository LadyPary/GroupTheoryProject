<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project provides a computer program for users which makes them able to process useful information about finite groups. Here users can simply input their desired data according to the instructions and get their needed information. With the use of this framework users will be able to:
1. Determine the group order
2. Generate the elements of the group
3. Get the group identity
4. Get the order of an element
5. Get the inverse of an element
6. Get the composition of two elements
7. Check if the group is abelian
8. Generate the centre
9. Check whether a set of arbitrary integers with the operation of addition mod n form a group or not

### Built With
* [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
 - Google Colaboratory

### Usage
First you have to open **[Copy_of_PIFG_for_Github.ipynb](https://github.com/LadyPary/GroupTheoryProject/blob/master/Copy_of_PIFG_for_Github.ipynb)** . Then click on the **Open in Colab** badge. Please note that you need a google account to use colab.
The Instructions on how to use this project are given in each section. You do not need to be familiar with colab.

The python code and all the functions are hidden under the **All the Functions** section.
