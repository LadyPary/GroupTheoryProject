Please follow the instructions given in the google colab project.

# Introduction:
This project provides a computer program for users which makes them able to process useful informations about finite groups. Here users can simply input their desired data according to the instructions and get their needed information. With the use of this framework users will be able to:
1. Determine the group order
2. Generate the elements of the group
3. Get the group identity
4. Get the order of an element
5. Get the inverse of an element
6. Get the composition of two elements
7. Check if the group is abelian
8. Generate the centre
9. Check whether a set of arbitrary integers with the operation of addition mod n form a group or not
